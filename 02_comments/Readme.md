# Comments in Python

- Comments are used to describe the logic in program or labels for other users to understand the code easily.
- Single Line Comment (Start form #). It is easy to implement (shortcut press ctrl + /).
- Multi Line Comment (""" description """). Use single or double line quotes.
- Python does not have built in support for multiline commnet but we use triple quotes for descrptive comments.
