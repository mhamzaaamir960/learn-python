# Variables in Python

- Variables are blocks in the memory to store values we can say variables are labels or refrences of values and when we access these variable names they return values which are stored in these variables.

### Naming convention of variables in python

- Variable names can contain only letters, numbers and underscores.
- Variable must be start with letters or underscores not with numbers. e.g. message_1, n1 but not 1_message or 1n.
- Spacing is not allowed in variables but we use undersores to seprate variables like "greeting_message"
  other than "greeting message".
- Don't use python reserved keywords for variables like print, def etc.
- Variable names should be short but descriptive like name is better than n, name_length is better than length_of_person_name.
- Be careful when using the lowecase letter l and uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.

### Constant Variables in python

- Python has no built in support for constant variables but by convention we use uppercase variable names to indicate that a variable should be treated as constant.
