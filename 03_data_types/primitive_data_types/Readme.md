# Primitive Data Types in Python

- String (str)
- Integer (int)
- Float (float)
- Complex (complex)
- Boolean (bool)

## String (str)

- A string `(str)` in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in single('), double(") or triple quotes (''' or """).
- It is immutable (unchangable) data type.

#### String Methods

1. `.upper()` => All letters will be capital letters.
2. `.lower()` => All letters will be small letters.
3. `.title()` => The first letter of each word will be capital.
4. `.capitalize()` => First letter of first word will be capital.
5. `.swapcase()` => Swap letters (small letters will be capital and capital letters will be small)
6. `.casefold()` => It converts text to lowercase more aggressively than `.lower()`, making it ideal for case-insensitive comparisons, especially in multilingual text.

## Integer (int)

The integer `(int)` data type is used to represent whole numbers, both positive and negative including zero. Python integers have arbitary precision, meaning they can grow as large as the available memory allows. It does not have fixed no. of bits for integers.
