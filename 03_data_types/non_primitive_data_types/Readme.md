# Non-Primitive Data Types (Can be mutable or immutable)

1. `List (list)`
2. `Tuple (tuple)`
3. `Set (set)`
4. `Frozen Set (frozenset)`
5. `Dictionary (dict)`
6. `Byte Array (bytearray)`
7. `Memory View (memoryview)`

## List (list)

A list is a built-in mutable data structure in Python that allows you to store ordered collections of items.

- A list can contain different data types such as integers, string, floats or even other lists.
- List is created using square brackets `[]` or `list()` constructor.

### List Characteristics

- `Ordered:` Items in a list maintain their insetion order (since Python 3.7)
- `Mutable:` List allow modifications (adding, removing, and uploading elements)
- `Allows Duplicates:` The same value can appear multiple times.
- `Heterogeneous:` Can store different data types in the same list.
